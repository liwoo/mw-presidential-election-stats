# 2020 Presidential Election Data Extraction Summary

## Overview
Successfully extracted and generated missing district-level presidential election results for 2020 from PDF data, following TDD principles and chain-of-thought reasoning.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Data Analysis
- **Existing Files**: Found 20 existing district files in `2020/results/presidential/`
- **Missing Districts**: Identified 9+ missing districts from the data
- **Format Analysis**: Studied the 2014 BL_RESULTS.json structure to understand required format
- **Metadata Integration**: Mapped constituency names to district codes using metadata

### 2. Data Extraction (`extract_2020_results.py`)
- **PDF Processing**: Parsed `data/Constituency2020PresidentialResults.pdf.txt`
- **Multi-line Handling**: Developed robust text parsing for inconsistent line breaks
- **Constituency Mapping**: Implemented intelligent district-to-constituency mapping
- **Candidate Codes**: Used correct 2020 candidate codes:
  - `LAZCHA` (Lazarus Chakwera - MCP)
  - `PETKUW` (Peter Dominico Sinosi Driver Kuwani - MMD)
  - `PETMUT` (Arthur Peter Mutharika - DPP)

### 3. Generated District Files (29 Total)
Successfully created JSON files for all districts, including missing ones:

**Northern Region:**
- CT (Chitipa) - 5 constituencies
- KR (Karonga) - 5 constituencies  
- RU (Rumphi) - 4 constituencies
- ZU (Mzuzu) - 1 constituency
- MZ (Mzimba) - 11 constituencies
- NB (Nkhatabay) - 5 constituencies *(previously missing)*
- LK (Likoma) - 1 constituency

**Central Region:**
- NK (Nkhotakota) - 5 constituencies
- KS (Kasungu) - 9 constituencies
- LI (Lilongwe) - 21 constituencies
- DO (Dowa) - 6 constituencies
- SA (Salima) - 6 constituencies
- MC (Mchinji) - 7 constituencies
- NI (Ntchisi) - 4 constituencies
- DE (Dedza) - 8 constituencies *(previously missing)*

**Southern Region:**
- NU (Ntcheu) - 8 constituencies
- BA (Balaka) - 4 constituencies *(previously missing)*
- MG (Mangochi) - 12 constituencies
- MH (Machinga) - 7 constituencies
- ZO (Zomba) - 10 constituencies
- PH (Phalombe) - 5 constituencies
- CR (Chiradzulu) - 5 constituencies *(previously missing)*
- BL (Blantyre) - 13 constituencies
- MU (Mulanje) - 9 constituencies
- TH (Thyolo) - 7 constituencies *(previously missing)*
- NE (Neno) - 2 constituencies *(previously missing)*
- MW (Mwanza) - 2 constituencies *(previously missing)*
- NS (Nsanje) - 5 constituencies *(previously missing)*
- CK (Chikwawa) - 6 constituencies *(previously missing)*

### 4. Data Validation (`validate_2020_results.py`)
- **Structure Validation**: All 29 files passed structure validation
- **Data Integrity**: Verified candidate codes, party mappings, and vote counts
- **Format Compliance**: Ensured consistency with existing JSON format
- **Total Votes Counted**: 4,379,979 valid votes + 57,061 null votes

### 5. Election Results Summary
**Final 2020 Presidential Election Results:**
- **LAZCHA (MCP)**: 2,584,148 votes (59.0%) - **WINNER**
- **PETMUT (DPP)**: 1,762,961 votes (40.3%)
- **PETKUW (MMD)**: 32,870 votes (0.8%)

## Technical Implementation

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Applied
1. **Problem Analysis**: Identified missing districts by comparing existing files to PDF data
2. **Format Study**: Analyzed 2014 structure to ensure consistency
3. **Metadata Integration**: Used administration.json for proper constituency-district mapping
4. **Iterative Development**: Built extraction logic incrementally with validation

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Structure Tests**: Validated JSON schema compliance
2. **Data Tests**: Verified candidate codes and party mappings
3. **Integration Tests**: Ensured constituency codes match metadata
4. **Regression Tests**: Confirmed all districts processed correctly

### Code Quality
- **Error Handling**: Robust parsing with detailed error reporting
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation with warnings and errors
- **Documentation**: Clear code comments and type hints
- **Modularity**: Separate extraction and validation scripts

## Files Created
- `extract_2020_results.py` - Main extraction script
- `validate_2020_results.py` - Validation and verification script
- 29 district JSON files in `2020/results/presidential/`
- This summary document

## Verification
âœ… **All validations passed successfully**
- 0 errors found
- 0 warnings found
- All 29 district files properly formatted
- Complete constituency coverage achieved
- Candidate and party codes validated
- Vote totals verified

## Impact
This extraction successfully filled the gaps in the 2020 presidential election data, providing complete district-level results that match the required JSON format and can be integrated seamlessly with the existing election statistics system.
