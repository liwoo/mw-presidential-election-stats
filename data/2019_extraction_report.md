# 2019 Parliamentary Election Data Extraction Report

## Summary

Successfully extracted and processed parliamentary election results from the 2019 Malawi General Election PDF, generating 18 district JSON files following the same structure as the 2014 parliamentary data.

## Data Overview

### Overall Statistics
- **Districts processed**: 18
- **Total constituencies**: 46
- **Total candidates**: 1,091
- **Total votes**: 4,353,844

### Party Performance (2019)
| Party  | Votes     | Percentage |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| MCP    | 1,606,245 | 36.9%      |
| IND    | 1,363,121 | 31.3%      |
| DPP    | 823,099   | 18.9%      |
| UTM    | 277,494   | 6.4%       |
| UDF    | 188,289   | 4.3%       |
| PP     | 79,935    | 1.8%       |
| AFORD  | 12,766    | 0.3%       |
| DePeCo | 2,895     | 0.1%       |

## Processing Challenges

### 1. Complex Text Format
The 2019 PDF contained polling station-level data with:
- Multi-line fragmented context information
- Embedded location details within vote totals
- Inconsistent formatting across regions
- OCR artifacts and parsing errors

### 2. Data Structure Differences
Unlike 2014's clean constituency-level structure, 2019 data required:
- Aggregation from polling station level to constituency level
- Complex regex patterns for context extraction
- Robust error handling for malformed lines

### 3. Parsing Artifacts Cleaned
- Fixed 90 candidate records with parsing errors
- Converted invalid party codes (e.g., "school", "T/Office", "5Namiyango") to "IND"
- Standardized candidate codes by removing OCR artifacts

## Data Quality Issues

### Validation Results
- **16 errors** detected across 8 district files
- **0 warnings**

### Error Types
1. **Duplicate candidates** (9 errors): Same candidate-party combination appears multiple times in a constituency
2. **Duplicate constituency codes** (7 errors): Same constituency code appears multiple times within a district

### Affected Districts
- BL: 2 errors (duplicate candidates)
- KR: 2 errors (duplicate constituency + duplicate candidate)
- KS: 1 error (duplicate candidate)
- LI: 3 errors (duplicate constituencies + duplicate candidate)
- MG: 1 error (duplicate candidate)
- MZ: 5 errors (multiple duplicate candidates)
- NK: 1 error (duplicate constituency)
- PH: 1 error (duplicate candidate)

## Technical Implementation

### Scripts Created
1. **parliamentary_extractor_2019_complete.py**: Initial extraction attempt
2. **parliamentary_extractor_2019_robust.py**: Enhanced parser with better error handling
3. **cleanup_2019_parliamentary.py**: Post-processing cleanup of parsing errors
4. **validate_2019_parliamentary.py**: Data validation and quality checks

### Key Features
- Multi-line context reconstruction
- Fuzzy matching for district/constituency name variations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Data aggregation from polling station to constituency level
- Post-processing cleanup of OCR artifacts

## Comparison with 2014 Data

### Similarities
- Same JSON structure format
- District-based file organization
- Constituency-candidate-vote hierarchy

### Differences
- **Source format**: 2014 had cleaner constituency-level data; 2019 required aggregation from polling stations
- **Data volume**: 2019 has more granular source data requiring complex aggregation
- **Processing complexity**: 2019 required significantly more sophisticated parsing logic

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Address duplicates**: Investigate and resolve the 16 validation errors before using data in production
2. **Manual verification**: Spot-check key constituencies against the original PDF
3. **Cross-validation**: Compare totals with official MEC results if available

### For Further Development
1. **Enhanced deduplication**: Implement logic to handle legitimate vs. erroneous duplicates
2. **Constituency mapping**: Create a comprehensive constituency code to name mapping
3. **Quality metrics**: Add more sophisticated data quality checks
